### 原文

I would like to thank the organizers of the China Development Forum for giving me the opportunity to make remarks to a group with which I hava been associated before and which conducts meetings of such international importance.

The title of the forum this year is "China on a new journey toward modernisation".

And I might say, when I came here to China for the first time 50 years ago, the China that existed then is hard to compare with a China that exist today. If anyone then had drawn me a picture of current Beijing, and if I compare it with that existed at that time, I woule not have believed it possible that so much progress could be made.

But the essence of this development forum, it to bring together the views of people from all over the world.

And in this year, the concept of cooperation amongst ideas is emphasized by the experience of the pandemic and by the enormous technologic development, that is taking place in so many countries and importantly in China and the United States.

When I came to China 50 years ago, I had the honor of opening relations that have been broken off for 25 years. And in my opening remarks(见周恩来), I said something about the mystery of China. And Premier ZHOU enlai has said to me what is so mysterious about China.

In the half a century since, I have learned a lot about China. And the relationship between the China and United States developed in a very positive way on the basis of cooperation on key issues.

In recent years, there have been some issues for discussion, and I am very hopeful that in the dialogue that is starting in Alaska later this week considerable process will be made.

But fundamentally, China and United States are 2 great societies with a diffrent culture and a diffrent history. So we, of necessity, sometimes have a different view of practice as they arise. But at the same time, the modern technology, and the global communications, and the global economy require that 2 societies begin ever more intensive efforts to work together. Because the peace and prosperity of the world depend on an understanding between the 2 societies.

The China Development Forum makes an important contribution to this progress by inviting people and CEOs from all over the world to exchange the ideas with their Chinese colleagues, so that all sides can learn from each other. So I would like to express my own appreciation for the hospitality that has been shown to me on previous visits to this Forum and to emphasis how important it is to have cooperative and positive ralations between the major industrial and technological countries in the world and between China and the United States.

Thank you for giving me this oppotunity.
